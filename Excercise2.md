# Adding tracks to the view  
It's easy to add new tracks to each browser's view. The most difficult part is knowing which tracks have the information you want to see.  
## Adding regulation tracks in UCSC  
There are several regulatory regions available in the set tracks for UCSC. Data from the ENCODE project are featured, with H3K27Ac shown by default. You can add more, though.  
* Go down to the set of track selection panels, and under Regulatory, click on the name "ENCODE Regulation".  
  * Any set of tracks that has a folder next to it will have multiple tracks that may or may not show in the browser's default view. By clicking on the track name, you can add more.  
* Add the methylation tracks (and any others you're interested in), then click the "Refresh" button in the blue ribbon header for the track set.  The browser will refresh.
* However, you may not like the look of the display, or you may want to see if there are more track options.  
  * Click on the vertical bar on the left side of the track, and try changing the Overlay Method, Track Height, and change the scaling to auto-scale.  
  * If you don't see the regulatory feature you're interested in, click on the text link "Broad Histone" in the Description on this configuration page. It will open a chart of all the features and cell lines you can add, (though some regulatory features are not available for all cell lines).
  * You can always de-select any of the cell types from the bottom list.  
  * When you're done, hit the "Submit" button near the top of the selection panel.

## Adding regulation tracks in Ensembl  
Regulation tracks are a little more "tricky" in Ensembl. They don't display featured tracks in the browser view. Instead, you must click on "Configure this page" in the left side menu.
