# Exercise 3 - Variant Tracks  
Variants are numerous, especially in the annotated human genome, so genome browser variant tracks can be overloaded with short variants. The two genome browsers vary in how they show (or don't show) variants in the browser graphic.  

## Variants in UCSC  
By default, UCSC shows the current dbSNP variant release in the pack view. If you expand this view to "full", you will see why depicting variants graphically can be challenging.
